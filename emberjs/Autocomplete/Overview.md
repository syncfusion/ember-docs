# Overview

The Autocomplete control for EmberJS is a input textbox control that provides a list of suggestions based on the user query. When the user enters a text in the text box, the control performs the search operation and provides a list of results in the suggestion pop up. There are several filter types available to perform the search.

**Key Features**

* Multi word Search: Supports searching using multiple words. 

* Data binding: Supports data binding with JSON data and remote data.

* Template: Supports templates for customizing the suggestion list content.

* Highlight Search: Supports highlighting the typed text in the suggestion list.

* Auto Fill: Allows the control to automatically select the first suggested item.

* Keyboard Interaction: Supports using the keyboard to focus on the control, navigate through the suggestion results, and select a value.
