# Overview

The **pivot client** control provides support to bind both **OLAP** and **relational** data sources. You can visualize the results in graphical and tabular formats (chart and grid). The **pivot client** control is also used to create and edit a report on-the-fly that is stored for later use.

**Key features**

The key features of the **pivot client** control are listed as follows:

* **Data source**: Binds the **pivot client** control with relational data source and **XML/A** data sources.
* **Axis element builder**: Allows building an **OLAP/Pivot** report by placing elements in different axes of the **pivot client**. There are four axes that are supported namely column, row, slicer, and values.
* **Member editor**: Lists out the members of the selected field for relational data source and members of the selected hierarchy in a tree view like structure for OLAP data source.
* **Toolbar**: The toolbar of the **pivot client** component provides options to export and manipulate the **OLAP/Pivot** report such as add report, new report, remove report, etc.
* **Cube dimension browser**: A tree view like structure that organizes the dimensions, measures, and named sets from the selected OLAP cube into independent logical groups.
* **Field list**: A list that explores the fields available in the connected relational data source.
* **Visualization controls**: For a diagrammatic representation of the multidimensional data.
