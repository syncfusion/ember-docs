# Getting Started

Before we start with the Sparkline, please refer [this page](https://help.syncfusion.com/emberjs/overview) for general information regarding integrating Syncfusion widgetâ€™s.

## Adding JavaScript and CSS Reference

To render the Sparkline control, the following list of external dependencies are needed, 

* [jsRender](https://github.com/borismoore/jsrender) - to render the templates

The other required internal dependencies are tabulated below,

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         <b>Files</b>
      </th>
      <th>
         <b>Description/Usage </b>
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         ej.core.min.js
      </td>
      <td>
        It is referred always before using all the JS controls.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         ej.data.min.js
      </td>
      <td>
         Used to handle data operation and is used while binding data to the JS controls.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
        ej.sparkline.min.js
      </td>
      <td>
        Sparkline core script file which includes Sparkline related scripts files.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

Refer the `ej.web.all.min.js` which encapsulates all the `ej` controls and frameworks in a single file.

## Control Initialization

* Open the command prompt in the folder [ember-app](https://help.syncfusion.com/emberjs/getting-started#create-a-simple-ember-application) or the folder in which the application is created.

* Use the command [ember generate route sparkline/default](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.11.0/routing/defining-your-routes/)to create template `default.hbs` file in templates folder and router `default.js` file in routes folder. It also add the routing content in `router.js`.

* Use below code in `default.hbs` in templates folder to render the sparkline.

{% highlight html %}

	{{ej-sparkline id="Sparkline"}}

{% endhighlight %}

* Use the below code in `default.js` in routes folder to bind the model to the sparkline.

{% highlight html %}

	import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
      model() {
         return {
         }
      }
    });

{% endhighlight %}

## Running the application

* To run the application, execute below command.

{% highlight javascript %}
 
 ember serve

{% endhighlight %}

* Browse to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the application. And navigate to sparkline sample. The component is rendered as like the below screenshot. You can make changes in the code found under app folder and the browser should auto-refresh itself while you save files.
